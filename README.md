# Motivation

As the twitter API is now limited and requires proper approval for tweeting, I have developed this solution as an automated way to tweet for you.

# Prerequisites
1. Chrome must be installed, and download the driver for your OS [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads), make sure to check your chrome version with [chrome://version](chrome://version) before installing the driver.
2. Update the config.ini file with your credentials.

## How to run it?

Run the main.py script
```
python3 main.py
```
